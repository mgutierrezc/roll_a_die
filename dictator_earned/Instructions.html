    <p> Both Participant A and Participant B worked on this counting task and earned a reward
        of {{ Constants.endowment_dictator|cu }} points.
        The difficulty of the task was however different for the two participants.
        <strong>One of the participants had to count symbols in two times the number
            of tables as the other participant, and hence worked harder.</strong>
        Both participants know that one of them had to work harder, but don't know who.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participant A now makes two decisions. They choose
        how to distribute the reward between themself and Participant B,
        if Participant A worked harder, and if Participant B worked harder.
        Specifically, Participant A chooses a number of points between 0 and {{ Constants.endowment_dictator }}
        to give to Participant B as the reward for Participant B's efforts in the counting task
        and keeps the remaining points, conditional on who worked harder. Participant B also knows this.
        Participant B makes <strong>no</strong> decisions.

    <p>Please answer the example questions below to proceed.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Suppose Participant A gives 400 reward points to Participant B.
