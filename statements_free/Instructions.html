    <p>In this part of the experiment, you will read a series of statements.
        These statements correspond to situations people face in their daily lives.
        You will read statements like "I would do X". You will be asked how likely you are to do X.</p>

    <p>In each statement, you can answer "Definitely no", "No", "Maybe", "Yes", or "Definitely yes".
        In each of your responses, we would like you to answer <strong>as truthfully as possible.</strong> </p>

    <p>The experiment consists of two sections.
        In each section, you will respond to statements as described above.
        At the end of the experiment, we will randomly select one of the two sections
        to determine your earnings for Part II. Your earnings from Part II will be
        added to your earnings from Part I and the participation fee. </p>

    <i>We will go through an example statement on the next page.</i>
