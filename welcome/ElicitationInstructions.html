    <p>At the beginning of each situation, you will go through some examples.
        You will need to answer the example questions correctly to proceed to the task,
        so please read them carefully. Keep in mind that the numbers in the examples are randomly
        chosen and do <strong>not</strong> have a meaning.</p>

<p>We do <strong>not</strong> want what happens in one situation to affect your decisions in another.
    So, after the end of the experiment, we will randomly select 5 of the situations from Part I
    and use these to determine your payment for Part I. For each situation, we will also randomly select
    one of the possible actions that Participant X could take. Thus, we will select both a situation and
    one possible action at random. </p>

    <p>For each of the 5 selected actions, we will determine which response
        was selected by most people in the experiment for that particular action.
        For each action, you will earn {{ Constants.bonus|cu }} if you gave the same response as that most
        frequently given by other people in the experiment.</p>

    <p>Your total earnings from Part I can therefore be
        {{ bonus0 }}, {{ bonus1 }}, {{ bonus2 }}, {{ bonus3 }}, {{ bonus4 }} or {{ bonus5 }} points.
        Your earnings from Part I will be added to the participation fee. </p>

    <p>Because only some decisions will count for your payment, but it is
        <strong>not</strong> yet known which ones, we suggest that you
        treat each decision as if it is the only one that matters for your final payment.</p>
    <p>

        <i> This is the end of the instructions for this part. We will now go through an example.</i>

    <p>Consider a task that involves two types of participants: Participant X and Participant Y.</p>

    <p>In this task, Participant X will make a choice that affects the payoffs of both participants.
        Suppose that Participant X has to choose between 3 different options, where</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Option 1 yields 0 points to Participant X and 200 points to Participant Y.</li>
        <li>Option 2 yields 100 points to Participant X and 100 points to Participant Y.</li>
        <li>Option 3 yields 200 points to Participant X and 0 points to Participant Y.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For each option, you will be asked to indicate how socially appropriate that option is.
        More specifically, you will choose one of the following appropriateness levels for each option:
        "Very socially inappropriate", "Somewhat socially inappropriate", "Somewhat socially appropriate",
        or "Very socially appropriate".</p>

    <p>If this task is chosen for payment, we will then randomly select one of the options above.
        Suppose Option 3 is selected. We will then compare your answer for Option 3 to
        the answer given by most people in the experiment. If you give the same answer as most people,
        you will earn {{ Constants.bonus|cu }}.
        <strong>It is therefore important that you submit your best guess on how socially appropriate
            you think each option is.</strong></p>

        Please answer the example questions below to proceed.
