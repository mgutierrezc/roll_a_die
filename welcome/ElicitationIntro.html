<p>On the following screens, you will read descriptions of a series of situations.
    These descriptions correspond to situations in which one person, "Participant X", must make a decision.
    For each situation, you will be given a description of the decision faced by Participant X.
    This description will
    include several possible choices available to Participant X.</p>

<p>After you read the description of the decision, you will be asked to evaluate the different
    actions available to Participant X and to decide, for each action, whether taking that
    action would be socially appropriate (consistent with moral or proper social behavior) or
    socially inappropriate (inconsistent with moral or proper social behavior). By socially
    appropriate, we mean behavior that most people agree is the "correct" or "ethical" thing to do.</p>

<p>In each of your responses, we would like you to answer
    <strong>as truthfully as possible</strong>, based on your opinions of what
    constitutes socially appropriate or socially inappropriate behavior.</p>
