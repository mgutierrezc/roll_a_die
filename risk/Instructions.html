    <p>This part of the experiment involves an investment task.</p>

    <p>You are given {{ Constants.endowment }} and can choose a
        portion of this amount to invest in an asset. The money not invested is yours to keep.
    There is a {{ Constants.prob }} chance that the investment in the asset will be successful.
        If it is successful, you will receive {{ Constants.multiplier }} times the amount invested.
        If it is unsuccessful, you will lose the amount invested.</p>

    <p>
        If the investment task is chosen for your payment in Part III,
        your earnings from this task will be added to your earnings from Part I and
        Part II, and the participation fee.</p>

    <p>Please answer the example questions below to proceed.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Suppose you invest 120 points in the asset.
