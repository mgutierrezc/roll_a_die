    <p>In Section II, you will read the statements from Section I once again and answer
        how likely you are to take the action in each statement.
        You are endowed with {{ Constants.section2_endowment|cu }} for Section II. </p>

    <p>If Section II is chosen for your payment, your earnings from Section II
        will be added to your participation fee and other earnings from the experiment.
        For each statement in Section II, you can answer "Definitely no", "No", "Maybe", "Yes", "Definitely yes".
        However, your earnings now depend on your answer. More specifically, it costs you </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            5 points to answer "Definitely no"
        </li>

            10 points to answer "No"
        </li>
        <li>
            15 points to answer "Maybe"
        </li>
        <li>
            20 points to answer "Yes"
        </li>
        <li>
            25 points to answer "Definitely yes"
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In each of your responses, we would like you to answer <strong>as truthfully as possible.</strong> </p>


    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> want your answers in one statement to affect your decisions in another.
        So after the end of the study we will randomly choose 20 statements
        and use these to determine your earnings in Part II, if Section II is chosen for your payment in Part II.</p>

    <p>Because only some decisions will count for your payment, but it is <strong>not</strong> yet known which
        ones, we suggest that you treat each decision as if it is the only one that matters for your final payment.</p>

    <i>We will go through an example statement on the next page.</i>

    <p>You will be then asked to indicate how likely you are to take the action in the statement.

        with the household chores when you visit them.You can answer "Definitely no", "No", "Maybe", "Yes",
